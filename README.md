# Crystal Project Archipelago Mod Installer

This is the Archipelago mod installer for Crystal Project. Check out [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/) or 
the [Archipelago GitHub](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) for information about what Archipelago is!

## Crystal Project Mod Installation Procedures

.Net 8.0 Desktop Runtime x64 (not .Net Core or the SDK!) is required to run the Crystal Project Archipelago Mod Installer: 
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

In your Steam library, right-click Crystal Project in the list and select "Properties...". Go to the Betas section, 
open the Beta Participation dropdown, and select the archipelago branch (version 1.6.5).

Download and extract the .zip file containing the installer and necessary files from the 
[Releases](https://github.com/Emerassi/Crystal-Project-Archipelago-Mod-Installer) page. Run CrystalProjectAPInstaller.exe, and
in the file dialogue box select your Crystal Project executable (Crystal Project.exe), or navigate to it if it is not
automatically selected. If the installer displays the message "Patching successful!" you know the mod is successfully
installed! You may launch Crystal Project as normal using Steam to play with Archipelago.

To uninstall, verify integrity of game files on Steam and it will return you to the unmodified version.

For more information about installation, generating a game, or using the mod see the 
[Crystal Project Randomizer Setup Guide](https://github.com/Emerassi/CrystalProjectAPWorld/blob/main/worlds/crystal_project/docs/setup_en.md)
